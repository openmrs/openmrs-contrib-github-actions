# OpenMRS Shared GitHub Workflows

This repository contains shared GitHub workflows intended for use in various OpenMRS repositories.

For the most part, our GitHub Actions workflows are quite standardized across repositories. However, we still maintain them at the per-repo level, which is less than ideal. These shared workflows can be easily re-used to setup new GitHub Repos.

For more on shared GitHub workflows, see [the GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

## Usage

To use one of the provided workflows in this repo, you need to create a new workflow in the repo with a job that uses the appropriate workflow defined here. Note that we intend to add [Starter Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization) to assist with this process.
